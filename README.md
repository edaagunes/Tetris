# Tetris
>Tetris is a tile-matching video game created by Russian software engineer Alexey Pajitnov in 1984. In Tetris, players complete lines by moving differently shaped pieces (tetrominoes), which descend onto the playing field. The completed lines disappear and grant the player points, and the player can proceed to fill the vacated spaces. The game ends when the playing field is filled. The longer the player can delay this inevitable outcome, the higher their score will be.

- Built-in Unity Version 2021.3.6f1

## About This Project
**Game Scene**

Original Tetris shapes were used in the project. The shapes were enabled to move on the ground with grid logic.

A smooth transition to the game was achieved by adding the login screen.

A level of logic was created. When the required lines for each level were cleared, it was possible to move on to the next level.

Added particle effects that will appear when lines are completed.

Necessary adjustments have been made so that it can be played on both PC and Android.
* Created touch controls for Android that can be customized during gameplay via the Pause Menu.

By adding music and sound effects, the game has been made more enjoyable to play.
* Dotween library and particle system were used for effects.

**Main Menu Scene**

A Start button has been placed to start the game.
